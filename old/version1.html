            <p class="lead">It’s Christmas time in Tree Town and all the Trees are <span class="bloody"> dying </span> to look their best.</p>
            <p class="lead">After a string of disappearances,
              Small Paul (the puniest tree in Tree Town) and Noel
              (the mayor's daughter) begin
              to questions Tree Town’s relationship with the
              venerated Farmer Todd —
              who has been acting
              particularly strange
              as of late.</p>
            <p class="lead">Will this unlikely duo
              crack the case before
              the annual Christmas
              Pageant? Or will the
              Trees of Tree Town
              discover the true
              meaning of
              aXe-mas this year…</p>
